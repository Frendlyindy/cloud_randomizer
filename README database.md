# Overview

My movie randomizer but with a firebase database. I wanted to use a database instead of just storing everything in a text file. While I still need to integrate with the randomizer, I can add, delete and read from the database.

# Cloud Database

I am using firestore from Google Firebase. 

The database uses a single collection that then leads to multiple documents. Inside each document is a field containing one movie title each. 

# Development Environment
